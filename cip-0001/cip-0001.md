## Abstract

This proposal defines a new logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on BIP-0032, BIP-0043, BIP-0044 (from now on) and defining a new purpose scheme for handling Self-Sovereign Identity keys. 
<!-- TODO: (Verify that doesn't exist a standard on how to generate and store FIDO authn keys) With some changes it could be also used to hierarchly generate FIDO authentication keys.  -->
 
<!-- TODO: briefly explain the usage -->

## Motivation

We want to avoid to deal with keys are not related to each other, since this type of key generation will lead to store and handle a JBOK wallet, from the phrase "Just a Bunch of Keys.‚Äù. This proposal allows the handling of multiple keys per verifiable data registry.

## Path levels

We define the following 7 levels in BIP-0032 path:

```
m / purpose' / registry' / method_type' / did' / verification_method / fragment
```

<!-- 
The following 5 levels are defined in the BIP-0044:
```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index 
```
-->

Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.

Each level has a special meaning, described in the chapters below.

### Purpose

<!-- TODO: verify that this number has not been used by someone else. 551 will represent SSI -->
Purpose is a constant set to 1361' (or 0x80000551) following the BIP43 recommendation.
It indicates that the subtree of this node is used according to this specification.

Hardened derivation is used at this level.

### Registry

One master node (seed) can be used for unlimited number of independent
verifiable data registry such as Bitcoin, Iota Tangle or Nameregistry. 
<!-- However, sharing the same
space for various cryptocoins has some disadvantages.

This level creates a separate subtree for every cryptocoin, avoiding
reusing addresses across cryptocoins and improving privacy issues. -->

Registry is a constant, set for each verifiable data registry. This constant could be the same as the list of already allocated coin types is in the chapter "Registered coin types" of [SLIP-0044](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md), while for newone developers may ask for registering unused number for their project.

Hardened derivation is used at this level.

### Method type

TODO: explain the method type following the DID standard
A verifiable data registry have one or more DID method. A DID method specification defines the mechanisms for creating, resolving, updating, and deactivating DIDs and DID documents. This level allow the wallet to handle different methods for the same verifiable data registry.

Hardened derivation is used at this level.

### DID (Account)

Hardened derivation is used at this level.

<!-- This level splits the key space into independent user identities,
so the wallet never mixes the keys across different accounts.

Users can use these accounts to organize the funds in the same
fashion as bank accounts; for donation purposes (where all
addresses are considered public), for saving purposes,
for common expenses etc.

Accounts are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner.
This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.

Software should prevent a creation of an account if a previous account does not
have a transaction history (meaning none of its addresses have been used before).

Software needs to discover all used accounts after importing the seed from
an external source. Such an algorithm is described in "Account discovery" chapter. -->

### Verification method

According to the [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), the following constant are defined:
 - 0 for a general *verification material*
 - 1 for *authentication* (verification relationship)
 - 2 for *assersion method* (verification relationship)
 - 3 *key agreement* (verification relationship)
 - 4 *capability invocation* (verification relationship)
 - 5 *capability delegation* (verification relationship)

Public derivation is used at this level.

### Index 

Key pair are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner.
<!-- This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation. -->

Public derivation is used at this level.

## Account discovery
<!-- 
When the master seed is imported from an external source the software should
start to discover the accounts in the following manner:

- derive the first account's node (index = 0)
- derive the external chain node of this account
- scan addresses of the external chain; respect the gap limit described below
- if no transactions are found on the external chain, stop discovery
- if there are some transactions, increase the account index and go to step 1

This algorithm is successful because software should disallow creation of new
accounts if previous one has no transaction history, as described in chapter
"Account" above.

Please note that the algorithm works with the transaction history, not account
balances, so you can have an account with 0 total coins and the algorithm will
still continue with discovery. -->
